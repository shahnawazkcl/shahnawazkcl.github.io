Hello, I'm Ali  
I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about many different things in the series of blogs, Stay tuned.  
    👋 I’m a computational biologist cum Bioinformatician and life long learner.  
    👀 I’m interested in Deep Learning and its application in Medicine.  
    🌱 My lifelong goal is to keep learning and making it easy for others to understand as that was not for me.  
    📫 You can reach me on twitter @shahnawaz_mbd.  
    ⚡️ Fun fact: I like playing Cricket, football and Chess.

_I write whenever i get time. So keep coming back...As Learning is **MARATHON** not a **SPRINT**!!_

__Hope you are going to enjoy reading !__
