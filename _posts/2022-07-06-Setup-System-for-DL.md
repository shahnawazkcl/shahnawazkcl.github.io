# Setup your system for Deeplearning  

Hello, there fellow deep learners. I am writing this blogpost to not only document how I did setup my system for running deep learning algorithms but also to make it easy for others to understand How to.  
In this blog post, I am going to take you through steps involved in setting up your __Ubuntu20.04__ system for running Deep Learning models. In the duecorse i promise to make it as simple as possible with some insights along the way.  

> *Disclaimer: If you are an expert in any of the concepts, steps or terms discussed here, then please do comment or correct me. Although here my only goal is to make and keep it __simple__.*   

.....be patient populating soon....
